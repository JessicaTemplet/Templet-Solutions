<h1>Bio</h1>
<p>spent 15+ years in the legal field writing briefs, motions, and appellate documentsâ€”including a writ of certiorari that went before the Supreme Court. That work taught me how to research exhaustively, argue persuasively, and break down complex information into clear, actionable guidance. I hold a Juris Doctor (JD) from Arkansas State University School of Law, though I&#x27;ve never practiced as an attorney.</p>

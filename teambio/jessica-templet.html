                <h2>The Foundation: Precision and Authority</h2>
                <p>My career began not in digital marketing, but in the highly rigorous field of **legal writing**. For over 15 years, I specialized in drafting complex briefs, motions, and appellate documents—including a writ of certiorari that successfully went before the Supreme Court. This background demanded **exhaustive research**, the ability to **argue persuasively**, and the skill to break down complex information into clear, defensible, and actionable guidance.</p>
                <p>This experience is the bedrock of Templet Solutions. While I hold a **Juris Doctor (JD)** from Arkansas State University School of Law, I never practiced as an attorney. Instead, I apply the core principles of jurisprudence—establishing credibility, evidence-based reasoning, and clear communication—to the world of AI search and content strategy. If content can pass the scrutiny of a judicial panel, it's ready for an AI algorithm.</p>

            <section id="aico-expertise">
                <h2>Pioneering AI Citation Optimization (AICO)</h2>
                <p>The rise of Generative AI and conversational search fundamentally changed SEO. The simple goal of ranking #1 was replaced by the need to be the source that AI systems like Google's Gemini, Perplexity, or Anthropic's Claude **cite as authoritative fact**. Recognizing this shift early on, I developed the **C³AT Framework** (Credibility, Context, Connection, Actionability, Technical Excellence).</p>
                <p>The C³AT Framework is a proprietary system designed specifically to make content inherently citation-worthy. This isn't traditional SEO; it's a strategic process of content engineering that focuses on the signals AI models look for when synthesizing answers. I work with clients to ensure their intellectual property is not just read by people, but is formally referenced by the very systems that are rewriting search itself.</p>

            <section id="our-mission">
                <h2>My Commitment to Clients</h2>
                <p>My mission at Templet Solutions is simple: to transform your business's deep knowledge into undeniable digital authority. I treat every client engagement as a critical case, ensuring your content is defensible, precise, and structured for maximum AI visibility. When you work with Templet Solutions, you're not just getting an SEO consultant; you're getting a strategist who knows how to structure information so precisely that it becomes impossible for AI to ignore.</p>

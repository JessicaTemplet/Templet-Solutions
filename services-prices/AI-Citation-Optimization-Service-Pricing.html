    <h2 id="investment-calculator">Investment Calculator: Example ROI Scenario</h2>
    <p>If C³AT optimization increases your AI citations by 200% (conservative based on case study data), and each additional AI citation drives an average of 10 qualified visitors per month, and your visitor-to-lead conversion rate is 5%, and your lead-to-customer rate is 20%, and your average customer value is $5,000:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>20 additional AI citations &times; 10 visitors = 200 visitors/month</li>
        <li>200 visitors &times; 5% conversion = 10 leads/month</li>
        <li>10 leads &times; 20% close rate = 2 customers/month</li>
        <li>2 customers &times; $5,000 = $10,000/month in new revenue</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A $4,000/month Growth Package investment generating $10,000/month in new revenue = **2.5x ROI.**</p>
    <p>Actual results vary based on industry, competition, and implementation quality.</p>

    <h3 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Q: Can I start with an audit and then move to a retainer?</dt>
        <dd>Yes. Most clients begin with the C³AT Framework Content Audit to understand their current state and opportunities, then move to monthly retainer services for ongoing optimization.</dd>
        
        <dt>Q: What if I need more content optimized than my package includes?</dt>
        <dd>Additional content can be added at $400-600 per piece depending on complexity and length. Or you can simply upgrade to the next service tier.</dd>
        
        <dt>Q: Do you write content or just optimize existing content?</dt>
        <dd>We primarily optimize existing content, but we offer Done-For-You content creation as an add-on service for clients who need C³AT-optimized content written from scratch.</dd>
        
        <dt>Q: How quickly will I see results?</dt>
        <dd>Initial AI citation improvements typically appear within 4-8 weeks. Significant authority building through content clusters takes 4-6 months of consistent implementation.</dd>
        
        <dt>Q: What makes your approach different from traditional SEO services?</dt>
        <dd>Traditional SEO optimizes for search engine rankings. AICO using the C³AT Framework optimizes specifically for AI system citations in conversational responses. These require different optimization strategies, though they complement each other.</dd>
        
        <dt>Q: Do you guarantee specific citation numbers?</dt>
        <dd>No. AI citation frequency depends on many factors including topic competition, content quality, and AI platform algorithm changes. We guarantee systematic implementation of proven C³AT principles, not specific citation counts.</dd>

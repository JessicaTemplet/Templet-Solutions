Schedule a complimentary consultation to discuss your goals, current content situation, and how the C³AT Framework can help you dominate AI citations in your industry. [Schedule Your Discovery Call] Frequently Asked Questions Q: Can I start with an audit and then move to a retainer? Yes. Most clients begin with the C³AT Framework Content Audit to understand their current state and opportunities, then move to monthly retainer services for ongoing optimization. Q: What if I need more content optimized than my package includes? Additional content can be added at $400-600 per piece depending on complexity and length. Or you can simply upgrade to the next service tier. Q: Do you write content or just optimize existing content? We primarily optimize existing content, but we offer Done-For-You content creation as an add-on service for clients who need C³AT-optimized content written from scratch. Q: How quickly will I see results? Initial AI citation improvements typically appear within 4-8 weeks. Significant authority building through content clusters takes 4-6 months of consistent implementation. Q: What makes your approach different from traditional SEO services? Traditional SEO optimizes for search engine rankings. AICO using the C³AT Framework optimizes specifically for AI system citations in conversational responses. These require different optimization strategies, though they complement each other. Q: Do you guarantee specific citation numbers? No. AI citation frequency depends on many factors including topic competition, content quality, and AI platform algorithm changes. We guarantee systematic implementation of proven C³AT principles, not specific citation counts. Pricing current as of October 04, 2025. Services and pricing subject to change.

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h3 id="faq-start">Q: Can I start with an audit and then move to a retainer?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. Most clients begin with the **AI Visibility Blueprint** to understand their current state
                    and opportunities, then move to monthly retainer services for ongoing optimization.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h3 id="faq-content-volume">Q: What if I need more content optimized than my package includes?</h3>
                <p>
                    Additional content can be added at **$400-600 per piece** depending on complexity and length. Or you
                    can simply upgrade to the next service tier.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h3 id="faq-content-writing">Q: Do you write content or just optimize existing content?</h3>
                <p>
                    We primarily optimize existing content, but we offer **Done-For-You content creation** as an add-on
                    service for clients who need C⁴AT³-optimized content written from scratch.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h3 id="faq-results">Q: How quickly will I see results?</h3>
                <p>
                    Initial AI citation improvements typically appear within **4-8 weeks**. Significant authority
                    building through content clusters takes **4-6 months** of consistent implementation.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h3 id="faq-aico-vs-seo">Q: What makes your approach different from traditional SEO services?</h3>
                <p>
                    Traditional SEO optimizes for search engine rankings. AICO using the **C⁴AT³ Framework** optimizes
                    specifically for **AI system citations** in conversational responses. These require different
                    optimization strategies, though they complement each other. However, at Templet Solutions we ensure
                    the SEO foundation is sound before we build on it. If any SEO deficiencies are found, they will be
                    corrected first.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h3 id="faq-guarantee">Q: Do you guarantee specific citation numbers?</h3>
                <p>
                    No. AI citation frequency depends on many factors including topic competition, content quality, and
                    AI platform algorithm changes. We guarantee systematic implementation of **proven C⁴AT³ principles**,
                    not specific citation counts.

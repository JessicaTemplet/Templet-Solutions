                        <p>Yes. Most clients begin with the **AI Visibility Blueprint** to understand their current state and opportunities, then move to monthly retainer services for ongoing optimization.</p>

                        <p>Initial AI citation improvements typically appear within **4-8 weeks**. Significant authority building through content clusters takes **4-6 months** of consistent implementation.</p>

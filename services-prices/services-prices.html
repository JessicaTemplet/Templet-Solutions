          <div class="feature-card animate-on-scroll">
            <h3>Q: Can I start with an audit and then move to a retainer?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Most clients begin with the <strong>AI Visibility Blueprint</strong> to understand their current state and opportunities, then move to monthly retainer services for ongoing optimization.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card animate-on-scroll">
            <h3>Q: What if I need more content optimized than my package includes?</h3>
            <p>Additional content can be added at <strong>$400–600 per piece</strong> depending on complexity and length. Or you can simply upgrade to the next service tier.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card animate-on-scroll">
            <h3>Q: How quickly will I see results?</h3>
            <p>Initial AI citation improvements typically appear within <strong>4–8 weeks</strong>. Significant authority building through content clusters takes <strong>4–6 months</strong> of consistent implementation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card animate-on-scroll">
            <h3>Q: What makes your approach different from traditional SEO services?</h3>
            <p>AICO using the <strong>C⁴AT³ Framework</strong> optimizes specifically for <strong>AI system citations</strong> in conversational responses, which requires different strategies than traditional search rankings.</p>

<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>About Us In 2022, like millions of others, our founder tested the first commercially available AI tools. The realization was immediate: the entire landscape of search was about to be profoundly impacted. What was missing was the research—the fundamental data on how AI systems would evaluate, reference, and cite web content. Because that research didn&#x27;t exist, we decided to do it ourselves.</p>
<p>Templet Solutions was established to answer the most critical question facing content creators and businesses today: How do you move from simply ranking high to being cited as an authoritative source of truth by AI?</p>
<p>Our mission is to arm businesses with the data-driven strategy needed to thrive in the conversational search era. We bridge the gap between traditional SEO and AI Citation Optimization (AICO) by leveraging proprietary research that tracks, quantifies, and predicts AI citation behavior.</p>
<p>Our Core Difference: The C³AT Framework</p>
<p>Our strategic recommendations are not based on speculation, but on the findings of our systematic research methodology. The resulting C³AT Framework (Credibility, Context, Content Clusters, Actionability, Technical Excellence) is the roadmap for creating content that AI systems trust, understand, and, most importantly, reference.</p>
<p>The future of visibility is citation. We provide the science and the strategy to make you a critical source.</p>

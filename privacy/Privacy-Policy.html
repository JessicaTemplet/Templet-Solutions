    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Third-Party Processors</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, trade, or share your personal information with any third parties for their independent marketing purposes.</p>

    <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>Embedded Tracking:</strong> MailerLite includes tracking pixels in the emails we send. This allows us to see if you open the email or click a link.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>As our primary data processors (MailerLite, Zoho, and Stripe) are based in the United States, your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to and processed in a country outside of your home jurisdiction.

    </ul>
    <p>If you unsubscribe from the email list, we will retain your email address on a "suppression list" to ensure we do not email you again, but we will delete all other associated engagement data upon your request for full data deletion.</p>

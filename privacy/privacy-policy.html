<h1>Templet Solutions Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Templet Solutions Privacy Policy Last Updated: October 4, 2025 1. Introduction This Privacy Policy explains how Templet Solutions ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects the personal information you provide to us solely for the purpose of receiving email communications and facilitating service consultation. We are committed to maintaining the trust and confidence of our subscribers and visitors. We will only use your personal information to send you the content you requested and to manage necessary business functions (scheduling, payments). 2. Data We Collect When you subscribe to our email list or consult with us, we collect the following Personal Data: * Email Address: Mandatory for receiving email communications. * Name, Address, Phone Number: Collected if you are retained for services (e.g., consultation, scheduling, and billing purposes). * Technical Data: Our email service provider (MailerLite) automatically collects data such as your IP address, subscription source, time of subscription, and engagement data (e.g., whether you opened an email or clicked a link). 3. How We Use Your Data We use the collected Personal Data for the following specific purposes: | Purpose of Use | Legal Basis (GDPR) | |---|---| | Email Communications | Consent | | To send you the weekly news letters and special offers that you explicitly subscribed to. |  | | Service Provision | Contractual Necessity | | To schedule consultations, confirm appointments, and facilitate billing for contracted services. |  | | System Integrity | Legitimate Interest | | To maintain our subscriber list, filter out spam, and verify your consent (proof of opt-in). |  | | Service Improvement | Legitimate Interest | | To track email open rates and link clicks to improve the content we send you. |  | 4. Data Sharing and Third-Party Processors We do not sell, rent, trade, or share your personal information with any third parties for their independent marketing purposes. We use the following essential third-party services, which act as data processors on our behalf: * MailerLite: Used to store your email address securely and send out our email communications. * Zoho: Used as our CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system and Calendar tool for storing client contact information (Name, Address, Phone Number) and managing scheduling and consultation purposes. * Stripe: Used to process payments for any services you purchase. We do not store your full payment card details; these are securely managed by Stripe. You can review the privacy policies for these services on their respective websites. 5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies * Cookies: While we have not intentionally set any cookies to track your personal information for marketing, please be aware that our website platform or the embedded sign-up forms may set essential technical cookies necessary for the function of the website and to track basic statistics. * Embedded Tracking: MailerLite includes tracking pixels in the emails we send. This allows us to see if you open the email or click a link. 6. International Data Transfers As our primary data processors (MailerLite, Zoho, and Stripe) are based in the United States, your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to and processed in a country outside of your home jurisdiction. By subscribing or using our services, you consent to this transfer. 7. Data Retention We will retain your Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy: * Subscriber Data: We retain your email address and associated engagement data until you unsubscribe or request erasure. * Client Data: We retain client contact and consultation data (Name, Address, Phone Number) for a minimum of seven (7) years after the conclusion of service, as required for legal and tax compliance. If you unsubscribe from the email list, we will retain your email address on a "suppression list" to ensure we do not email you again, but we will delete all other associated engagement data upon your request for full data deletion. 8.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at the designated email address below. * Right to Access: You can request a copy of the personal data we hold about you. * Right to Rectification: You can ask us to correct or complete inaccurate data we hold about you. * Right to Erasure ('Right to be Forgotten'): You can ask us to permanently delete all personal data we hold about you. * Right to Restrict Processing: You can ask us to stop using your data (e.g., if you believe the data is inaccurate). * Right to Object: You can object to us processing your data, including the use of tracking for email open rates. * Right to Unsubscribe: You can instantly stop receiving our emails by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link present at the bottom of every email we send. * Right to Lodge a Complaint: You have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority in your country regarding our processing of your personal data. 9. Data Security We take reasonable technical and organizational steps to protect your personal data, including using secure service providers (MailerLite, Zoho, Stripe) that adhere to industry standards for data protection and encryption. 10.

<p>Templet Solutions Privacy Policy Last Updated: October 4, 2025 1. Introduction This Privacy Policy explains how Templet Solutions (&quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) collects, uses, and protects the personal information you provide to us solely for the purpose of receiving email communications and facilitating service consultation.
